CHANGELOG
=========

1.0 (2012-03-12)
  Initial release

1.1 (2013-03-06) 
  Widget size is kept as the maximum seen to avoid jiggling other
  plugins. Widget size can be reset by entering the configuration.

1.2 (2013-03-10)
  Text is now aligned to the right in the x-coordinate and in the
  center on the y-coordinate. The text is now customizable using html
  markup.

1.3 (2013-04-08)
  Added the gpl2 license COPYING file to the repository.

1.4 (2013-05-29) 
  The default delay of 1 second can now be changed (to a minimum of 10
  ms). Also, easy Arch Linux installation instructions added by
  graysky2.

1.5 (2014-05-24) 
  (1) Fixed compilation problems on Ubuntu 14.04 by properly depending
  on glib. 
  (2) on Removed dependency on lxpanel-dev package (because it is not
  available on Ubuntu 14.04), the required lxpanel/plugin.h is now
  packaged along side. 
  (3) Improved installation script by trying all sorts of methods to
  locate lxpanel/plugins (try 'pkg-control lxpanel', search for
  deskno.so (a built-in plugin) in various common lib folders).

1.6 (2014-05-24)
  'make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install' is now supported to prepend
  "/tmp/stage" to where it would otherwise install the plugin.
  'make LXPANEL_PLUGINS_DIR=/usr/lib/lxpanel/plugins install' installs
  the plugin (copied sensors.co) into '/usr/lib/lxpanel/plugins'.
  Version 1.4 handled DESTDIR like LXPANEL_PLUGINS_DIR is handled
  now. DESTDIR now follows the standard (from
  https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html ).
  My thanks to https://github.com/rikardfalkeborn for these fixes.

1.7 (2014-05-24)
  Fixed problem with installation not working on systems where
  'pkg-control --variable=libdir lxpanel' returns something. I'm not
  sure what this returns exactly so we search for a builtin-plugin in
  what is returned. From the autotools of the lxpanel example plugin
  it looks like it returns e.g. '/usr/lib/lxpanel', but on a Arch
  linux system it returns '/usr/lib/'.

1.8 (2020-05-26)
  Add parameter that lets you override how sensor numbers are
  formattet. For example if you set it to "%.0lf%s", then temperatures
  wont have any decimals.
